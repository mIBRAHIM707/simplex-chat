# Read Receipts Testing Checklist

## 🎯 What You Implemented

### Backend Integration (Already Working)
- ✅ Backend supports `MDSSndRead` message status
- ✅ Read receipt transmission via SimpleX protocol
- ✅ Database storage of read status

### Frontend Features You Added
- ✅ **Visual Status Indicators**: Different colored double ticks for read messages
- ✅ **User Settings**: Toggle to enable/disable read receipts
- ✅ **Privacy Controls**: Separate settings for contacts vs groups

## 📱 Testing Steps

### 1. Privacy Settings Test
**Location**: Settings → Privacy Settings → Read Receipts
- [ ] Toggle "Send read receipts to contacts" ON/OFF
- [ ] Toggle "Send read receipts in small groups" ON/OFF
- [ ] Check settings are saved after app restart
- [ ] Verify alert dialogs show when enabling

### 2. Visual Indicators Test
**Location**: Chat conversation views
- [ ] Send message and verify single tick (sent)
- [ ] Wait for delivery and verify double tick (delivered)
- [ ] **NEW**: When recipient reads, verify colored double tick (read)
- [ ] Test in both individual chats and group chats

### 3. Read Receipt Flow Test
**Setup**: Two devices with your APK installed

**Device A (Sender)**:
1. [ ] Enable read receipts in Privacy Settings
2. [ ] Send message to Device B
3. [ ] Observe status progression: sent → delivered → read

**Device B (Reader)**:
1. [ ] Enable read receipts in Privacy Settings  
2. [ ] Receive message from Device A
3. [ ] Open/read the message
4. [ ] Verify Device A shows "read" status

### 4. Privacy Control Test
**Test Scenario**: Read receipts disabled
- [ ] Turn OFF read receipts on Device B
- [ ] Device A sends message
- [ ] Device B reads message
- [ ] Verify Device A does NOT show "read" status (stays at "delivered")

## 🎨 Visual Changes to Look For

### Message Status Icons
- **Single Tick**: Message sent (unchanged)
- **Gray Double Tick**: Message delivered (unchanged)
- **🆕 Colored Double Tick**: Message read (YOUR NEW FEATURE)

### Settings UI
- **🆕 Read Receipts Section** in Privacy Settings
- **🆕 Toggle Switches** for contacts and groups
- **🆕 Alert Dialogs** explaining privacy implications

## 🐛 Common Issues to Check

### If Read Status Not Showing:
1. [ ] Both users have read receipts enabled
2. [ ] Messages are actually being read (opened in chat)
3. [ ] Network connectivity for status updates
4. [ ] Backend logs show `MDSSndRead` events

### If Settings Not Working:
1. [ ] Settings persist after app restart
2. [ ] Toggle changes are reflected in API calls
3. [ ] UI updates immediately when toggled

### If Visual Indicators Wrong:
1. [ ] Check `CIMetaView.kt` status icon logic
2. [ ] Verify `SndRead` status is properly detected
3. [ ] Confirm correct icon colors/resources

## 📊 Success Criteria
